# 📋 Overview
This project showcases a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. By combining self-supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches, the methodology achieves robust performance with minimal labeled data, leveraging unlabeled data to enhance learning efficiency.

# 🚀 Key Features

1. Efficient Use of Data: Employs advanced techniques to maximize insights from a small labeled dataset and a large unlabeled dataset.

2. State-of-the-Art Embeddings: Utilizes high-quality sentence embeddings derived from a self-supervised transformer model.

3. Hybrid Learning Paradigm: Merges self-supervised pretraining with semi-supervised label propagation for superior model performance.

4. Scalability: The methods are adaptable to other datasets and domains with limited labeled data.


# 📚 Concepts


## 1. Self-Supervised Learning:
   
  Self-supervised learning generates supervision signals directly from the input data, eliminating the need for manual annotations. This is especially powerful in NLP, where pretrained language models such as transformers can learn representations that generalize well across tasks.

  In this project:
A pretrained transformer generates dense embeddings that encapsulate semantic information, making them ideal for downstream tasks like sentiment classification.

## 2. Semi-Supervised Learning:
   
  Semi-supervised learning leverages a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. This approach is crucial when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

  In this project:
A small labeled subset of the IMDB dataset is used to propagate labels to unlabeled examples via algorithms that exploit the geometry of data in embedding space.

# 🛠️ Methodology

## 1. Preprocessing:

The raw IMDB reviews are cleaned and normalized, removing noise like HTML tags and unnecessary characters. This ensures the data is ready for machine learning pipelines.

## 2. Embedding Extraction:

Each review is transformed into a dense, numerical representation using a pretrained self-supervised model. These embeddings capture the underlying meaning and context of the text.

## 3. Semi-Supervised Labeling:

The labeled and unlabeled embeddings are combined to propagate labels. The algorithm assigns labels to unlabeled data by evaluating the similarity of embeddings, creating a pseudo-labeled dataset.

## 4. Classification:

A lightweight classifier is trained on the labeled data to predict sentiments (positive or negative) for new reviews. This combines the strength of pretrained embeddings and efficient supervised learning.

## 5. Evaluation:

Model performance is compared between:
A fully supervised approach using all labeled data.
A semi-supervised approach using only a fraction of the labeled dataset.

# 🌟 Key Advantages
Data Efficiency: Achieves comparable results to fully supervised models using significantly fewer labeled samples.

Modularity: Easily integrates with other datasets or tasks by replacing embeddings or classifiers.

Scalability: Suitable for large-scale datasets with minimal labeling costs.


# 📊 Results
The project demonstrates:

Baseline Performance: A fully supervised model using all labeled data serves as the benchmark.

Semi-Supervised Success: Comparable performance is achieved with only 10% of the labeled data, thanks to the power of pretrained embeddings and label propagation.



# 💡 Applications
Sentiment Analysis: Effective for classifying user reviews, social media posts, or feedback into positive/negative sentiments.

Text Classification: The methodology can generalize to other tasks, such as spam detection or topic modeling.

Low-Resource NLP: A valuable framework for scenarios with limited labeled data.


# 📂 Structure
Dataset: IMDB reviews, split into labeled and unlabeled subsets.

Models: Pretrained transformer for embedding extraction and classical classifiers for sentiment analysis.

Algorithms: Self-supervised learning for embeddings and semi-supervised label propagation.

# 📝 Conclusion
This project highlights the power of combining self-supervised and semi-supervised learning in natural language processing. By leveraging high-quality embeddings and label propagation, it demonstrates how robust performance can be achieved with minimal labeled data. The approach is scalable, adaptable to various domains, and offers a cost-effective solution for data-scarce environments. This work serves as a foundation for further exploration into hybrid learning paradigms and their applications in sentiment analysis and beyond.
